[ ![Build](https://api.travis-ci.org/GabrielBB/Android-CutOut.svg?branch=master) ](https://api.travis-ci.org/GabrielBB/Android-CutOut.svg?branch=master)

## Usage

Add Gradle dependency:
```groovy
implementation 'com.github.gabrielbb:cutout:0.1.2'
```

Start the CutOut screen with this single line:

```java
CutOut.activity().start(this);
```

<img src="/images/Capture.JPG" width="200"> &nbsp; <img src="/images/Capture_2.JPG" width="200">

### Getting the result

```java
@Override
    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, @Nullable Intent data) {
        if (requestCode == CutOut.CUTOUT_ACTIVITY_REQUEST_CODE) {

            switch (resultCode) {
                case Activity.RESULT_OK:
                    Uri imageUri = CutOut.getUri(data);
                    // Save the image using the returned Uri here
                    break;
                case CutOut.CUTOUT_ACTIVITY_RESULT_ERROR_CODE:
                    Exception ex = CutOut.getError(data);
                    break;
                default:
                    System.out.print("User cancelled the CutOut screen");
            }
        }
    }
```

## Options

You can use one or more options from these:

```java
            CutOut.activity()
                    .src(uri)
                    .bordered()
                    .noCrop()
                    .intro()
		    .saveType(CutOutSaveTypes.SAVE_TO_STORAGE)
                    .start(this);
```

 - #### src

By default the user can select images from camera or gallery but you can also pass an `android.net.Uri` of an image that is already saved:

  ```java
Uri uri = Uri.parse("/images/cat.jpg");

CutOut.activity().src(uri).start(this);
```


 - #### bordered

  ```java
CutOut.activity().bordered().start(this);
```

This option makes the final PNG have a border around it. The default border color is White. You can also pass the `android.graphics.Color` of your choice.


 - #### noCrop

  ```java
CutOut.activity().noCrop().start(this);
```

By default and thanks to this library: [Android-Image-Cropper](https://github.com/ArthurHub/Android-Image-Cropper), the user can crop or rotate the image. This option disables that cropping screen.



 - #### intro

  ```java
CutOut.activity().intro().start(this);
```

Display an intro explaining every button usage. The user can skip the intro and it is only shown once. The images displayed in the intro are the same you saw in the "Features" section of this document.

## Change log
*0.1.2*
- Removed Admob Ads automatic integration. I will probably add it later. For now, it was causing problems.
- Images are now saved as temporary files in the cache directory. This guarantees that these images will be deleted when users uninstall your app or when the disk memory is low. If you want the images to live forever on the Gallery, you should take the returned Uri and save the image there by yourself.
